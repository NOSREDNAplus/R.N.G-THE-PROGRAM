Hello, User!
Welcome to my disgustingly simple random number generator made with python
As you can see there is a config.json file which you can open to customize the various different values of the program
And don't worry if you mess anything up because you can just delete the config.json file and the program will bring it back in it's default form
Thank you for using my app

P.S There are no external modules used in this projects only built-in python modules :)
